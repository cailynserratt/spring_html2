	<h1> Blue Rose Meaning</h1>
	<p><i titles= "meaning" style="font-size: 160%;">Blue roses aren't naturally occuring but as they are roses, which normally connect with love, blue roses symbolize unrequited love or true love. With lighter blue roses they can also mean something unattainable and mysterious but beautiful. </i></p>
